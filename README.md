# GooseEYE

Library to evaluate several geometrical statistical measures on 'images' (i.e. 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D matrices). These measures are explained based on examples in the [documentation](http://gooseeye.geus.me). 

The core of the implementation is a C++ library. For user convenience two interfaces are provided: (i) a graphical-user-interface (GUI) to perform most computations on a click-and-play basis, and (ii) a Python interface to perform more customized or automated computations.
